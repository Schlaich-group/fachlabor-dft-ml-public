Getting started
***************

.. container:: abstract

    In the following we will use DFT (Density Functional Theory) implemented in CP2K to calculate the energy and forces between argon atoms. 


Setting up our work environment
================================

.. container:: justify
    
    Create the following folder structure
    
.. code-block::
    :dedent: 0 

    |   your-project
    |   |---dft
    |   |   |---2_body_potential
    |   |   |---liquid_argon_85K
    
.. container:: justify

    In the following we will work with a Jupyter notebook. To do so, go into your folder ``2_body_potential`` and type 

.. code-block:: bash
    :dedent: 0

    jupyter notebook

.. container:: justify
    
    Now, the jupyter notebook editor opens in your browser. This is where we will work. 
    Continue now with :ref:`2_body_potential`.
