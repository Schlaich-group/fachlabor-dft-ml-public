Getting started
***************

.. container:: abstract

    In the following we will use DFT (Density Functional Theory) implemented in CP2K to calculate the energy and forces between argon atoms. 


Setting up our work environment
================================

.. container:: justify
    
    First, we will setup our working environment in VSCode. Note that the following tutorials can also be done with another editor of your choice.
    Open VSCode and select ``File->Open Folder``. Create a new folder for your project and open it.
    
    Then create the following folder structure
    
.. code-block::
    :dedent: 0 

    |   your-project
    |   |---dft
    |   |   |---2_body_potential
    |   |   |---liquid_argon_85K
    
.. container:: justify

    In the following we will work with a Jupyter notebook. Todo so, go to the next page :ref:`2_body_potential` and download the ipynb notebook from the end of the page.
    Place the notebook into your folder ``dft/2_body_potential``, then continue with doing the tutorial :ref:`2_body_potential`.
